# TrainerLights-Training-System-to-Improve-Athletes-Reflexes

It is a sports training system for athletes, which allows to measure and increase the capacity of reaction time to stimulation, or reflexes.

My basic purpose is to analyze which, why and how things are used in this project along with the code...

Hardware components
* 1 NodeMCU ESP8266 Breakout Board
* 5 NodeMCU per light and 5 NodeMCU Board for the server	
* 4 Ultrasonic Sensor - HC-SR04 (Generic)
* LED (generic) 48 blue 4 red 4 green Ã—	56	
* 4 Slide Switch	
* 4 General Purpose Transistor NPN	
* 4 Resistor 221 ohm
* 4 SparkFun LiPo Charger Basic - Micro-USB	
this can be taken apart from any portable cell charger
* 4 Li-Ion Battery 1000mAh	
this can be taken apart from any portable cell charger, check the photos and videos
* 4 Resistor 10k ohm	

Hand tools and fabrication machines
* 3D Printer (generic)

There are 4 (or more), lights, one of them is the "server"

The server holds 2 nodeMCU boards one is the server itself (the WiFi hotspot) and the other one is the sensor light, all other lights holds only 1 nodeMCU board each.

They are interconnected without wires via WiFi.

The user connects with the cell phone to this same server via WiFi.

Configure the system with parameters such as ignition time, delay, range of activation distances, and type of sequence (sequential or random).

All settings are available in a very simple screen shown in the cell phone.

No need to install software on the phone, just access a link in the browser to see the screen.

Connect the cell phone to the server via WiFi, browse to http://192.168.4.1 use TrainerLights named WiFi spot and password 1234567890

Thank you
